# Raiswap Subgraph

[Rai](https://rai.finance/) is a protocol designed to provide DeFi with a wider range of assets, a higher amount of liquidity, and a diverse set of financial use cases. When this feature set is combined with the cross-chain compatibility of the Polkadot ecosystem, it eliminates fragmentation across the existing DeFi ecosystem by bringing a complement of new assets and a higher amount of liquidity to decentralized finance.

This subgraph dynamically tracks any pair created by the raiswap factory. It tracks of the current state of Rai contracts, and contains derived stats for things like historical data and USD prices.
